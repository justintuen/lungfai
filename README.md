Using seven single-frequency antennas (4 at 2.45 GHz and 3 at 5.2 GHz) as the data source, this data serves as the foundational learning dataset for naturally generated dual-frequency antennas. Utilizing a PGGAN architecture with dimensions ranging from low to high (512x512), the trained neural network model is then used to generate unique dual-frequency antennas.
# UP G/D model h5 format
This dual-band antenna model(ZIP) is free for reader study only.
You can download it for personal use.
# Recently new broadband feature antenna

This broadband antenna is using other bb model.

An antenna can be generated every three seconds for experiments.
three single band antenna(2.45,3.4 and 5.2GHZ) to achieve this whole new bb antenna. One of antenna is included broadband feature.
# Training again
This G/D(512x512) model can be used to training again for antenna updated.
