I am a graduate student in the ECE Dept. at TKU.
Using seven single-frequency antennas (4 at 2.45 GHz and 3 at 5.2 GHz) as the data source, this data serves as the foundational learning dataset for naturally generated dual-frequency antennas. Utilizing a PGGAN architecture with dimensions ranging from low to high (512x512), the trained neural network model is then used to generate unique dual-frequency antennas.
