| **Advantages**       | Stable, high-quality generation, even with unclear conditions. | Fast optimization, accurate predictions. | Flexible, diverse designs, high innovation, adaptable to unclear conditions. |
| **Mathematical Basis** | PGGAN uses a progressively growing generative adversarial network, where the generator improves the resolution of designs over time, while the discriminator ensures that the generated designs resemble real data. | Machine Learning uses various algorithms like supervised and unsupervised learning. For example, algorithms like Random Forest and Support Vector Machines (SVM) help optimize and predict antenna design parameters by minimizing errors between predicted and actual values. | CGAN (Conditional GAN) generates designs based on specific conditions provided to the model. It adjusts the designs according to these conditions, ensuring that the generated designs meet specific criteria or requirements. |
| **Efficiency**       | Lower, time-consuming but precise. | Very high, suitable for rapid iterations. | Medium, high when conditions are clear; lower with multiple possibilities. |
| **Algorithm**        | Incremental design resolution increase. | Random Forest, SVM for optimization. | Generates designs based on specific conditions. |
