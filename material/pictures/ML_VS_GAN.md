# PGGAN vs. Traditional Machine Learning in Antenna Design

| **Feature/Technique** | **PGGAN** | **Traditional Machine Learning (ML)** |
|-----------------------|-----------|---------------------------------------|
| **Training Process**  | **Progressive Growth Training**: PGGAN stabilizes the training process by gradually increasing the network size for both the generator and discriminator. <br>**Mathematical Expression**: At each layer, the training goal is to minimize the generator loss `min_G V(D, G)` and maximize the discriminator loss `max_D V(D, G)`. The gradients are updated as follows for each layer: `∇θ_G V(G)` and `∇θ_D V(D)`. | **Supervised Learning**: Trained on labeled data to minimize the loss between predicted values and true values. <br>**Mathematical Expression**: Minimizing the loss function `L(θ) = (1/N) Σ (loss(y_i, ˆy_i(θ)))`, where `θ` represents the model parameters. <br>**Evolutionary Algorithms**: Includes methods like genetic algorithms or particle swarm optimization for searching and optimizing solutions. |
| **Loss Functions**    | **Adversarial Loss**: In PGGAN, the loss function becomes more complex as the generator and discriminator evolve: `min_G max_D E_{x ~ p_data(x)}[log D(x)] + E_{z ~ p_z(z)}[log(1 - D(G(z)))]`. As the network deepens, PGGAN uses interpolation techniques to smooth the loss calculations across different resolution layers. | **Supervised Learning Losses**: <br>- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Used for regression tasks, with the loss function: `L(θ) = (1/N) Σ (y_i - ˆy_i(θ))^2`. <br>- **Cross-Entropy Loss**: Used for classification tasks, with the loss function: `L(θ) = -(1/N) Σ [y_i log(ˆy_i(θ)) + (1 - y_i) log(1 - ˆy_i(θ))]`. |
| **Optimization Goals**| **Multi-Objective Optimization**: PGGAN aims to optimize the generator and discriminator across different resolution layers, making the generated images progressively more realistic. <br>**Mathematical Goal**: `min_G max_D V(D, G)`, where `V(D, G)` is the adversarial loss function. | **Single-Objective Optimization**: Typically focuses on minimizing a single loss function, such as reducing prediction error in supervised learning. <br>**Mathematical Goal**: `min_θ L(θ)`, where `L(θ)` is the loss function. |
| **Data Integration**  | **Data-Driven Generation**: PGGAN can generate new high-dimensional data that extends beyond the original training set. <br>**Mathematical Expression**: New data point `x'` is generated by the generator as: `x' = G(z)`, where `z ~ p_z(z)` is the random noise. As the layers deepen, interpolation is used to smooth transitions between the new and old layers. | **Data Dependency**: ML models' performance is highly dependent on the quality and quantity of training data. <br>**Mathematical Expression**: Predicted value `ˆy` is calculated based on input
