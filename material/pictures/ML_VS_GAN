|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Training Process**          | - **Progressive Growth Training**: PGGAN stabilizes the training process by gradually increasing the network size for both the generator and discriminator.<br>**Mathematical Expression**: At each layer, the training goal is to minimize the generator loss \( \min_G V(D, G) \) and maximize the discriminator loss \( \max_D V(D, G) \). The gradients are updated as follows for each layer:<br> \( \nabla_{\theta_G} V(G) \) and \( \nabla_{\theta_D} V(D) \). | - **Supervised Learning**: Trained on labeled data to minimize the loss between predicted values and true values.<br>**Mathematical Expression**: <br>Minimizing the loss function \( L(\theta) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \text{loss}(y_i, \hat{y}_i(\theta)) \), where \( \theta \) represents the model parameters.<br> - **Evolutionary Algorithms**: Includes methods like genetic algorithms or particle swarm optimization for searching and optimizing solutions. |
| **Loss Functions**            | - **Adversarial Loss**: In PGGAN, the loss function becomes more complex as the generator and discriminator evolve:<br> \( \min_G \max_D \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_{\text{data}}(x)}[\log D(x)] + \mathbb{E}_{z \sim p_z(z)}[\log(1 - D(G(z)))] \). As the network deepens, PGGAN uses interpolation techniques to smooth the loss calculations across different resolution layers.                                                    | - **Supervised Learning Losses**:<br> - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Used for regression tasks, with the loss function:<br> \( L(\theta) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_i - \hat{y}_i(\theta))^2 \).<br> - **Cross-Entropy Loss**: Used for classification tasks, with the loss function:<br> \( L(\theta) = -\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} [y_i \log(\hat{y}_i(\theta)) + (1 - y_i) \log(1 - \hat{y}_i(\theta))] \). |
| **Optimization Goals**        | - **Multi-Objective Optimization**: PGGAN aims to optimize the generator and discriminator across different resolution layers, making the generated images progressively more realistic.<br>**Mathematical Goal**:<br> \( \min_G \max_D V(D, G) \) , where \( V(D, G) \) is the adversarial loss function.                                                                                     | - **Single-Objective Optimization**: Typically focuses on minimizing a single loss function, such as reducing prediction error in supervised learning.<br>**Mathematical Goal**:<br> \( \min_\theta L(\theta) \), where \( L(\theta) \) is the loss function.                                                                                                                                  |
| **Data Integration**          | - **Data-Driven Generation**: PGGAN can generate new high-dimensional data that extends beyond the original training set.<br>**Mathematical Expression**:<br>New data point \( x' \) is generated by the generator as:<br> \( x' = G(z) \), where \( z \sim p_z(z) \) is the random noise. As the layers deepen, interpolation is used to smooth transitions between the new and old layers.                            | - **Data Dependency**: ML models' performance is highly dependent on the quality and quantity of training data.<br>**Mathematical Expression**:<br>Predicted value \( \hat{y} \) is calculated based on input features \( x \) and parameters \( \theta \):<br> \( \hat{y} = f(x; \theta) \). In evolutionary algorithms, as generations increase, the sample size evaluated by the fitness function also grows.                            |
| **Advantages**               | - **High Creativity**: Capable of generating novel and highly realistic antenna structures, especially excelling in multi-band antenna design.<br>- **High Stability**: Progressive growth improves training stability.<br>- **Flexibility**: Can generate high-dimensional, complex structures that go beyond traditional data limitations.                                                                        | - **High Interpretability**: Supervised learning methods are easy to interpret and effective in analyzing and predicting data.<br>- **Good Convergence**: With sufficient labeled data, models can converge quickly and produce stable results.<br>- **Computational Efficiency**: More efficient than PGGAN on smaller datasets, making it suitable for small-scale applications.                                                    |
| **Disadvantages**            | - **Complex Training**: Requires significant computational resources, and the training process can be slow.<br>- **Data-Intensive**: Requires large and diverse training data to generate high-quality designs.                                                                                                                                                                                                 | - **Limited Creativity**: May struggle to produce innovative designs, particularly in complex multi-band antenna design.<br>- **Data Dependence**: Performance can degrade significantly when labeled data is insufficient.                                                                                                                                                         |
